# Web Native Run on TestJet

In this section, you can run multiple test cases and track the test run's passing and failing rates in real time. 

A blue progress bar will appear when test cases are running. When a test case is executed a loader will appear on that test case. Passed test steps are represented by a green bar while failed test steps are represented by a green bar.
